# AI Integration Documentation

This document outlines how AI (specifically Claude) was used in developing the Earthquake Visualization Tool.

## 1. Architecture Design

### Component Structure
- Recommended separation of concerns:
  - Presentational components (`DataTable`, `ScatterPlot`)
  - Container components (`PlottingPane`)
  - Context providers and store setup

## 2. Code Implementation

### Data Management
- Implemented error handling and loading states
- Created type-safe interfaces for earthquake data

### UI/UX Improvements
- Added responsive design considerations
- Implemented virtualization for large datasets
- Enhanced tooltip formatting and interactions

## 3. Problem Solving

### Performance Optimization
- Implemented memoization strategies
- Optimized state updates
- Added virtualization for large datasets

### Type Safety
- Enhanced TypeScript configurations
- Added proper type definitions
- Resolved type-related issues in chart configuration

## 4. Code Quality

### Best Practices
- Implemented proper component memoization
- Added error boundaries and loading states
- Used TypeScript for type safety
- Followed React best practices

### Documentation
- Generated comprehensive README
- Added code comments
- Created type definitions
- Documented state management approach

## 5. Development Process

### AI-Assisted Problem Solving
- Debugging and error resolution
- Architecture decisions

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

### Code Review
- AI reviewed code for:
  - Type safety
  - Performance issues
  - Best practices
  - Potential bugs

### Optimization
- Identified performance bottlenecks
- Suggested optimization strategies
- Implemented performance improvements
